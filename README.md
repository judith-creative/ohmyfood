OpenClassrooms Projet 3 : Dynamiser une page web avec des animations CSS

Learning goal: use CSS animations
The site will have up to 5 HTML pages, one landing page and four restaurant detailed menu pages. Design remains simple and basic because emphasis is on CSS animations.

CSS animations on landing page:
button "prochainement" is followed by animated dots as if someone is typing
buttons "mentions légales" and "contactez-nous" must wiggle

CSS animations on each menu page:
when hovering over the titles "entrées", "plats", "desserts" they must be underlined from left to right
